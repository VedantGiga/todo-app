**Deploying the New Schema to Production**

**Step 1: Backup the Current Database**

Before making any changes to the production database, it's essential to create a backup to ensure that we can revert to the previous state if anything goes wrong.

```bash
# Backup the current database
pg_dump -U username database_name > backup.sql
```

**Step 2: Update the Schema**

Next, we need to update the schema using the new SQL script.

```sql
# Update the schema
psql -U username database_name < new_schema.sql
```

**Step 3: Verify the Schema**

After updating the schema, we need to verify that it's correct and working as expected.

```sql
# Verify the schema
psql -U username database_name
```

**Step 4: Deploy the Updated Schema to Production**

Once we've verified the schema, we can deploy it to production. This typically involves updating the database configuration and restarting any services that depend on the database.

```bash
# Restart any dependent services
sudo service postgresql restart
```

**Step 5: Test the New Schema**

Finally, we need to test the new schema to ensure it's working correctly. This includes running queries, checking data types, and verifying that all dependencies are working as expected.

```sql
# Test the new schema
psql -U username database_name
```

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose we have a database with a table called `users` and we want to add a new column called `email`.

```sql
# Old schema
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age INT
);

# New schema
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255);
```

We would update the schema by running the new SQL script, then verify that the schema is correct and working as expected.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Test the schema thoroughly**: Before deploying the schema to production, make sure to test it thoroughly to avoid any issues.
2. **Use version control**: Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to the schema and ensure that you can revert to previous versions if needed.
3. **Backup the database regularly**: Regularly backup the database to ensure that you can recover in case of an issue.
4. **Use a deployment script**: Use a deployment script to automate the deployment process and reduce the risk of human error.

**Error Handling:**

In case of an error during deployment, we can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

```sql
BEGIN TRY
  -- Deploy the new schema
  psql -U username database_name < new_schema.sql
  -- Restart any dependent services
  sudo service postgresql restart
  -- Test the new schema
  psql -U username database_name
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Handle the error
    RAISE NOTICE 'Error deploying schema: %', SQLERRM;
    -- Rollback the changes
    psql -U username database_name < backup.sql
    -- Revert to the previous state
    psql -U username database_name
```

By following these steps and best practices, we can ensure a smooth deployment of the new schema to production.
