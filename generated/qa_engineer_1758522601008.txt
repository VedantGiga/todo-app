**Testing Plan for New Schema**

**Objective:** To ensure the new schema is working correctly by identifying and addressing any potential issues or bugs.

**Scope:** This testing plan will focus on the following areas:

1. Data integrity
2. Data consistency
3. Data relationships
4. Query performance
5. Error handling

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Unit Testing:** Test individual components of the schema, such as tables, views, and stored procedures, to ensure they are working correctly in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing:** Test how different components of the schema interact with each other to ensure data is being exchanged correctly.
3. **System Testing:** Test the entire system to ensure it is working as expected and meets the requirements.
4. **Regression Testing:** Perform repeat testing to ensure that changes to the schema have not introduced new bugs or affected existing functionality.

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Happy Path Scenarios:**
	* Insert data into a table
	* Update data in a table
	* Delete data from a table
	* Query data from a table
	* Use a stored procedure to perform an operation
2. **Error Handling Scenarios:**
	* Insert invalid data into a table
	* Update data that does not exist in a table
	* Delete data from a table that does not exist
	* Run a query with invalid syntax
	* Use a stored procedure with invalid parameters
3. **Edge Case Scenarios:**
	* Insert data with duplicate keys
	* Update data with conflicting data types
	* Delete data from a table with dependencies
	* Query data with complex joins

**Testing Tools:**

1. **SQL Client Tools:** Use tools like SQL Server Management Studio, Oracle SQL Developer, or MySQL Workbench to execute SQL queries and test the schema.
2. **Automated Testing Tools:** Use tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI to automate testing and ensure consistency.
3. **API Testing Tools:** Use tools like Postman, SoapUI, or RestAssured to test APIs that interact with the schema.

**Testing Metrics:**

1. **Test Coverage:** Measure the percentage of the schema that has been tested.
2. **Test Pass Rate:** Measure the percentage of tests that have passed.
3. **Test Failure Rate:** Measure the percentage of tests that have failed.
4. **Error Rate:** Measure the number of errors encountered during testing.

**Testing Schedule:**

1. **Unit Testing:** Complete unit testing within 2 days of schema implementation.
2. **Integration Testing:** Complete integration testing within 3 days of unit testing.
3. **System Testing:** Complete system testing within 4 days of integration testing.
4. **Regression Testing:** Perform regression testing on a bi-weekly basis to ensure changes have not introduced new bugs.

**Testing Resources:**

1. **Development Team:** Provide the development team with the necessary resources and training to perform testing.
2. **Quality Assurance Team:** Provide the quality assurance team with the necessary resources and training to perform testing.
3. **Test Environment:** Ensure a suitable test environment is available to perform testing.

**Testing Deliverables:**

1. **Test Plan:** Document the test plan and testing approach.
2. **Test Cases:** Document the test cases and test scenarios.
3. **Test Results:** Document the test results, including pass rate, failure rate, and error rate.
4. **Test Report:** Document the final test report, including any issues found and recommendations for improvements.

By following this testing plan, we can ensure the new schema is working correctly and meet the requirements of the project.
